# Abstract

StaFi is a multi-chain liquid staking protocol that enables users to unlock the liquidity of their staked assets. It offers extensive token support for various blockchain ecosystems including EVM chains like ETH, MATIC, and BNB, as well as Cosmos chains such as ATOM, IRIS, HUAHUA, and SWTH. Furthermore, it supports Polkadot-based chains like DOT and KSM, and Solana chains like SOL.

Previously, the rToken applications on the StaFi Chain and the StaFi Hub operated and updated independently. This led to some confusion among users, as they were not sure which application to use. It also made it difficult for StaFi to promote its products and services to a wider audience.

This proposal seeks to merge the rToken applications on the StaFi Chain and the StaFi Hub. This will simplify the user experience and make it easier for StaFi to reach a wider audience.

# Motivation

In SIP-2, we explored the possibility of decoupling rTokens to improve the overall rToken experience. As part of this effort, we are working to merge the rToken applications on both the StaFi Chain and StaFi Hub. This integration will provide users with a seamless and consistent experience, eliminating any potential confusion that may result from using separate applications on different platforms.

Moreover, the merger can lead to improved operational efficiency by consolidating resources and streamlining development efforts. With a single application to maintain and update, StaFi’s development team can focus on enhancing the protocol’s features and functionality, rather than allocating resources to maintaining and updating two separate applications. This will result in quicker updates, faster bug fixes, and a more efficient allocation of resources, benefiting both the development team and the users of StaFi.

In addition, the merger can enhance StaFi’s branding by presenting a more cohesive and unified image to the community. Consolidating the rToken applications on a single platform can create a more seamless and recognizable brand identity, increasing brand awareness and recognition in the market. This can also improve the user experience and perception of StaFi, ultimately driving increased adoption and usage of the protocol. By improving both operational and branding efficiency, the merger can help StaFi achieve its goals and objectives more effectively.

# Specification

Currently, users must differentiate between the rToken applications on the StaFi Chain and StaFi Hub to stake and unstake tokens, leading to suboptimal user experience.

To address these issues, we propose a new user experience that involves merging the rToken applications on the StaFi Chain and StaFi Hub into a single application. This application will differentiate tokens based on their underlying chain ecosystem, and users can switch between different chains to stake and unstake tokens within the corresponding ecosystem. The specific differentiation rules are as follows:

- EVM: ETH, MATIC, BNB
- Cosmos: ATOM, IRIS, SWTH, HUAHUA
- Polkadot: FIS,DOT, KSM
- Solana: SOL

Moreover, we have redesigned the UI and UX of the new rToken app to streamline user operations. The new design provides a more consistent and cohesive experience, eliminating any confusion arising from using separate applications on different platforms. This creates a streamlined and user-friendly interface, making it easier for users to understand the functionality and benefits of StaFi.

Furthermore, we have unified our technology and services, creating a more efficient maintenance and expansion process. With only one set of services to maintain, StaFi’s development team can focus on enhancing the protocol’s features and functionality, rather than allocating resources to maintaining and updating separate applications. This leads to faster updates, bug fixes, and more efficient resource allocation, benefiting both the development team and the users of StaFi.

At the operational level, we will consolidate accounts and focus our operational resources on the StaFi_Protocol account. Additionally, we will merge related documents, such as the user guide, and migrate them from GitBook to GitHub. This migration will enable everyone to contribute to the content through GitHub, making it easier to update and maintain our documentation. Overall, these updates to our product and technology will enhance the user experience and make our maintenance and expansion processes more efficient.
